# Telecom-s-Churn-Analysis
## Project Overview :
Analyzed the dataset of European Telecom Company. Performed EDA on this data. This Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features) and  a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

## Tech stack :
- Python
- Pandas - For data cleaning and manipulation
- Seaborn - For data visualization
- Matplotlib - For data visualization

## Business Understanding Of A Telecom Industry Customer Churn :
Customer churn is a big problem in any industry and one of the most important concerns for the Telecom industry. 
The effect on the revenues of the companies, because of this customer churns is huge, especially in the telecom field, that's why these companies are seeking to develop a predictive potential customer churn. 
In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate, and it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, that's why customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
Therefore, finding those factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. 

##### The main goal of the project is to develop an understanding of the cause of customer churn, which will assist telecom operators in predicting customers who are most likely to churn and what to do to retain the most valuable customers.

## Analyzed the following variables :
1) Churn
2) State wise churn
3) Area code
4) Account length
5) International Plan
6) Voice mail plan
7) Number vmail messages
8) Customer Service Calls
9) Per Minute Charge
## Analyzed data using the following charts and graphs :
1) Line
2) Donut chart
3) Box plot
4) Bar plot
5) Distribution plot
6) Histogram
7) Pie

## Key Insights :
1) 14.49 % of customers are churned and almost 85.50 % of customers are non-churned
2) The count of churned customers is 483 and non-churned is 2850
3) The NJ and CA STATE have the highest churn mean rate which is 26.47
4) Area code 408 has the highest mean churn rate which is  14.558473
5) 3010 customers haven't an International plan and 323 have.
6) It was noticed that 323 customers were using the international plan, and 137 customers churned out of them, which means a churn percentage of 42.4
7) It was noticed that 3010 customers were not using the international plan, and 346 customers churned out of them, which means a churn percentage of 11.4
